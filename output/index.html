      <p>MaaS is able to calculate the least expensive route over multiple mobility providers as billing information has already been standardized . However, this does not include third-party payment schemes where a third party, such as a local government, compensates a part of a travellers’ trip cost when certain criteria are met. To automatize third-party agreements for MaaS, we propose (i) a specification to set up a third-party payment system specifying, among others, how multimodal criteria and trips can be semantically described, and (ii) an open source validator tool returning the compensation for a trip. In future work, we are investigating how personal data can be integrated using Solid data pods.</p>

        <!-- A variety of mobility solutions (bus, bike, step etc.) have taken their place in the public domain of cities. In Flanders, a new decree for Basic Accessibility (BA)<span class="references">\[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>\]</span> has been installed, which envisions that important social locations must be optimally accessible to travellers. This means that travellers must be able to combine different mobility solutions easily. Combined mobility should not only be the case for last-mile travel within cities, but also within the whole region of Flanders. So-called Mobi points are being installed on the public domain to make these mobility solutions more physically interoperable. Mobility as a service (MaaS) providers have multiple mobility solutions integrated and are therefore crucial to guide people along the most optimal route, such as the least expensive route.

        <p>Standardized data models (<a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs">GTFS</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>, <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification">MDS</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>) or Web APIs (<a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs">GBFS</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span>, <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://github.com/TOMP-WG/TOMP-API">TOMP API</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>) allow MaaS providers to calculate the financial cost of a trip, however, this does not exist for third-party payment schemes. The term ‘third-party payment’ (TPP) refers to the compensation a traveller receives from a third party, such as a local government, when a trip is performed compliant with the third parties’ criteria. Such a system can be achieved in a pre- or postpaid fashion. From the view point of a traveller, with prepaid, only a smaller part of the trip must be paid by the traveller; the other part is arranged between the third party and mobility provider. With postpaid, the traveller only gets compensated afterwards. In this article, we will focus on prepaid, being the most convenient for travellers. Prepaid can be implemented with vouchers or mobility budget containing, for example, free rides or credit. Another approach is an agreement describing the criteria and how a mobility provider invoices the third party. Cities already set up agreements with transport providers (<a href="#table-tpp">Table 1</a>) where local decisions define the criteria in the form of subsidy measurements. The overview on <a href="#table-tpp">Table 1</a> shows that criteria are based on location, time, transport modality and profile information. Currently, these TPPs are made ad hoc lowering the discoverability and reusability for route planning advice in MaaS. Therefore, we propose a specification for a prepaid TPP system defining the semantic description of subsidy measurements and trips, and an open-source validator to verify whether a trip is compliant with a subsidy measurement.</p>

        <p>The TPP specification<span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span> first describes the steps local governments and mobility operators can perform to compensate a travellers’ trip. Inspired by projects like the Mobility Data Specifications (<a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification">MDS</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>) and <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://data.vlaanderen.be/doc/applicatieprofiel/besluit-subsidie/">LBLOD</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span>, we specify which standards to use to describe subsidy measurements and trips, and how trips can be validated in an automated fashion. On the overview (<a href="#ttpdiagram">Fig. 1</a>), the system starts with the local government (agency), that defines which trips can be compensated. When a MaaS provider can implement the subsidy and conforms with the cities’ quality framework (QF), a TPP agreement can be arranged, which is annotated according to the Local Decisions as Linked Open Data (LBLOD)<span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span> Application Profile (AP) for subsidies <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span>. The trip of a user is described with the Open Standards for Linked Organizations (OSLO) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span> AP ‘trips and offer’<span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span> and can be validated with the semantically annotated agreement. When a trip meets the criteria, the validator returns how much can be compensated. For reimbursement, the mobility provider sends an invoice with the number of trip compensations.</p>

          </figcaption>
</figure>

        <!-- ### Agreement

A template for an agreement is provided that agencies can use to set up a TPP system with a MaaS provider. It contains 5 articles that describe:

- the criteria that a trip must comply to for compensation
- that extra costs behold to the user
- billing happens on a quarterly basis based on an anonymized report of the compensation usage. This can of course be changed to, for example every month.
- commitment to promote the TPP system to its residents and visitors
- duration and cancellation

For the criteria, the agency needs to fill in the means of transport (e.g. bike sharing system, train etc.) that must have been used during a trip. Also, its location is implicitly indicated with the administrative boundaries of the agency that initiates the agreement. Furthermore, the agency can set a fixed number of Euros that will be repaid to the MaaS provider when a trip meets the criteria. The duration is currently set to one year and renews automatically with one year. Another possibility would be to work with a fixed start and end date. A notice to cancel the agreement must be made at least 30 days before renewal.-->

        <!-- ### Agency -->

        <!-- The agency can apply a qualification framework to support their decision when selecting the most appropriate MaaS provider(s). This is not part of the template, but criteria that could be part of this are:

- Integration: are all the mobility providers (shared mobility and public transport) that are active in the city integrated into the MaaS application?
- Multimodal: are at least 3 modalities supported besides public transport? 
- Service level: is there a system for handling complaints and does it support Dutch and English?
- Level of service: are subscription formulas or societal beneficial integrations such as third-party payment schemes supported? 
- Availability: is the availability of shared mobility resources displayed in real time?
- Booking: is this available for B2C and does it support pay-as-you-go?-->

        <!-- A user story mapping workshop has been organised on 4th September 2019 with the partners of the  project. There it was clear that agencies want to offer compensations for at least certain means of transport, inside a certain location and for a certain time. Another important aspect is that agencies should be able to chain these criteria together so multimodal behaviour can be promoted. For example, remote municipalities can attract visitors that do not own cars by giving compensation when they take the train to the nearest station and then renting an electric bike for the last-mile travel.-->

        <p>Similarly to MDS, we provide a JSON(-LD) template with corresponding table for each type of object. 
This way, developers do not need to understand semantic technologies to start mapping their data. A JSON-LD context is added to make the template semantically interoperable. In <a href="#requirement">Fig. 2</a>, we give an example of a requirement for shared bikes in Leuven. Next to RouteSegmentRequirements, an  agency also needs to describe the SubsidyMeasurement, which combines multiple requirements, and Payment indicating how much will be compensated. More details can be found on the Github repo of the specification<span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span>. Similarly, providers need to map every trip to “trips and offer”<span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span>. A trip executes a certain route composing multiple route segments. These segments specify the departure and arrival time, GPS telemetry, price and transport modality. For example, <a href="#routesegment">Fig. 3</a> demonstrates a shared bike system during rush hours and costing 8.2 Euros. With the standardized description of a trip and subsidy measurement as input, an Open Source validator is being developed<span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span> returning whether a trip is conform with the subsidy measurement and how much compensation can be given. MaaS providers can incorporate this tool into their route planning engine. Also, agencies could use this tool as validation step before payment.</p>

        <!-- In future work, we will provide a programmatic API and publish it on the NPM registry for easier adoption. We also are looking into wrapping this with a Web API and offer this as a Docker container. -->

        <h2 property="schema:name">Conclusion</h2>

        <p>The specification and validator proposed in this demo sets the first steps towards third-party payments for MaaS. In future work, we want to make TPPs on the one hand more inclusive and on the other hand use the validator in a generic, cross-domain incentives (subsidy measurements) platform. Both aspects require the use or creation of personal data: the validator will need to be extended to handle profile information, and incentives should be assignable to a person. As cities nor MaaS operators should be responsible for managing personal data, we are looking into using Solid data pods, an innovative data storage solution for private data. With this last element added, we hope to have an interesting discussion during the workshop about the future ecosystem of TPPs for MaaS.</p>

        <!-- The TPP specification provides the first steps for deploying a third-party payment system that supports combined mobility inside a city. Cities can reuse the agreement, but will need a translation from Dutch if necessary. The JSON-LD description of the subsidy measurement needs to be defined separately from the agreement, but in future work non-technical profiles should be able to create this by using the semantic enabled editor Say, which is pushed forward by the LBLOD programme. A dynamic input form could be provided inside the agreement that creates the semantic annotations behind the screens. This description can also be used for the promotion of the TPP system by embedding it into the website of the city. A MaaS provider (cfr. Jeasy) already showed interest in harvesting this to increase the visibility of financially interesting routes to its users, similarly to healthier routes based on air quality or noise.

Both application profiles (AP), OSLO mobility “trips and offer” and LBLOD subsidy, are standardized within the Flemish government through the OSLO governance structure. They are respectively aligned with the European standards INSPIRE and CCCEV. To reuse our solution outside Flanders, it is important to make incentives towards these standards and the mentioned APs to increase the semantically interoperability with our proposed validator.

Like mobi points and MaaS are lowering the barrier for combined mobility, cities should also start to provide TPPs for combined mobility by working together with MaaS providers. In the end, with our proposed TPP specification, cities can deploy the same subsidy measurement with multiple MaaS providers, because they have to use the same validator. Also mobility providers can deploy this when the criteria are within their offering. This will be beneficial for the end user as they will have the ability to choose the mobility application to their liking. In the near future, we will test the TPP specification within a few cities and work further on the validator to make it an industry-ready tool.-->
