## Abstract

MaaS is able to calculate the least expensive route over multiple mobility providers as billing information has already been standardized . However, this does not include third-party payment schemes where a third party, such as a local government, compensates a part of a travellers’ trip cost when certain criteria are met. To automatize third-party agreements for MaaS, we propose (i) a specification to set up a third-party payment system specifying, among others, how multimodal criteria and trips can be semantically described, and (ii) an open source validator tool returning the compensation for a trip. In future work, we are investigating how personal data can be integrated using Solid data pods.
