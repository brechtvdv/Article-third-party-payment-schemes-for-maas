## Abstract

MaaS is able to calculate the least expensive route over multiple mobility providers as billing information has already been standardized . However, this does not include third-party payment schemes where a third-party, such as a local government, has a separate agreement with several mobility providers and compensates a part of a travellers’ trip cost when certain criteria are met. We propose (i) a specification to set up a third-party payment system between local governments and MaaS providers where multimodal criteria and trips are  semantically described and (ii) an open source validator tool that based on these descriptions returns how much of a trip can be compensated. With this specification, third-party payment schemes become a reality for MaaS too that allow local governments to make combined mobility a financially smarter choice for travellers.
