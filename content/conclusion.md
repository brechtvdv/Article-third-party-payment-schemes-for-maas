## Conclusion
{:#conclusion}

The specification and validator proposed in this demo sets the first steps towards third-party payments for MaaS. In future work, we want to make TPPs on the one hand more inclusive and on the other hand use the validator in a generic, cross-domain incentives (subsidy measurements) platform. Both aspects require the use or creation of personal data: the validator will need to be extended to handle profile information, and incentives should be assignable to a person. As cities nor MaaS operators should be responsible for managing personal data, we are looking into using Solid data pods, an innovative data storage solution for private data. With this last element added, we hope to have an interesting discussion during the workshop about the future ecosystem of TPPs for MaaS.

<!-- The TPP specification provides the first steps for deploying a third-party payment system that supports combined mobility inside a city. Cities can reuse the agreement, but will need a translation from Dutch if necessary. The JSON-LD description of the subsidy measurement needs to be defined separately from the agreement, but in future work non-technical profiles should be able to create this by using the semantic enabled editor Say, which is pushed forward by the LBLOD programme. A dynamic input form could be provided inside the agreement that creates the semantic annotations behind the screens. This description can also be used for the promotion of the TPP system by embedding it into the website of the city. A MaaS provider (cfr. Jeasy) already showed interest in harvesting this to increase the visibility of financially interesting routes to its users, similarly to healthier routes based on air quality or noise.

Both application profiles (AP), OSLO mobility “trips and offer” and LBLOD subsidy, are standardized within the Flemish government through the OSLO governance structure. They are respectively aligned with the European standards INSPIRE and CCCEV. To reuse our solution outside Flanders, it is important to make incentives towards these standards and the mentioned APs to increase the semantically interoperability with our proposed validator.

Like mobi points and MaaS are lowering the barrier for combined mobility, cities should also start to provide TPPs for combined mobility by working together with MaaS providers. In the end, with our proposed TPP specification, cities can deploy the same subsidy measurement with multiple MaaS providers, because they have to use the same validator. Also mobility providers can deploy this when the criteria are within their offering. This will be beneficial for the end user as they will have the ability to choose the mobility application to their liking. In the near future, we will test the TPP specification within a few cities and work further on the validator to make it an industry-ready tool.-->
